    My interests after working with elastic.io shifted a lot into developer
    tools. I was lucky to find a project in Wix that required to develop the
    internal developer tools. These tools included internal frameworks for
    Node.js, internal platforms for writing and deploying the code in
    production, internal libraries to share the guidelines of the company and so
    on. Well, you got the idea. I was part of the team that develops it for Wix
    developers, for our colleagues. Delivering better velocity when it comes to
    developing new services by delegating their pain on our shoulders. The
    outcome of such a team is to provide the internal platform for other
    developers on which the other products are built.

    It was the first time when I took sabbatical after working in Dev-Pro. Once
    it ended, I decided to join a small startup that provided a solution to
    integrate different sources and destinations between each other. That was
    the place where I was doing everything I knew and didn't know. Because of
    this, I learned a lot about building production APIs, managing clusters with
    Kubernetes, developing developer tools and so on and so forth. That's the
    place, where I learned a lot and grew as a software developer.

    After an amazing experience in Onix-Systems, I decided to change town and
    continue my journey elsewhere. Dev-Pro hired me to lead a small team of
    developers and to implement a library that communicates with the Point of
    Sale hardware. These devices are payment terminals, magnet card readers,
    thermal printers and everything else that is needed for POS to operate. It
    was a lot of reading, especially specifications for payment terminals, but,
    in the end, we delivered a library that can be built with the Angular and
    run in the Electron. So that the other team of Angular developers could
    communicate with the POS hardware without knowing the technical details of
    it behind.

    It's hard to describe what I was working with in the company. Started as a
    PHP developer working with the WordPress to implement a plugin for it. The
    plugin provided a possibility to integrate the website with banner-ads,
    e-mail subscribe forms, etc. But the fate decided otherwise and pretty soon
    the whole project was rewritten by me into Node.js, following by leading a
    team of Node.js developers onsite. That was pretty an interesting experience
    so will gladly discuss it on the interview.

    At some point, while freelancing, I found a client that had a lot of work to
    give. So that, I stopped freelancing and started working with one specific
    company and people. The project we were developing was about providing a
    user interface to manage the transport park. Including, but not limiting,
    vehicle tracking via GPS, storing archive data for replaying the timeline of
    the vehicle position and so on. The problem we solved is that managers in
    transport parks were able to monitor their vehicles and in the case of
    emergency immediately take action to help.

    While studying in the university, I had some freelancing stuff to work with
    to get along. Mostly, it was some minor programming, making landing pages,
    configuring CMS, reverse-engineering some stuff and so on. Nothing specific
    or something that worth mentioning, was trying to make my living, that's
    all.
