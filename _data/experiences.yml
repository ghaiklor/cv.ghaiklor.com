    Acting as a T-shaped developer I was doing a lot and nothing at once.
    Ranging from developing an API for our production to pushing DevOps culture.
    The reason behind it is that it is a startup with a limited resource but a
    lot of work to do. This is the place where I learned a lot about Kubernetes,
    Mesos, tweaking runtimes for better performance, profiling bottlenecks and
    the likes.

    The product I was working on was an Electron-based application for Point of
    Sale systems. More concrete, I was a team-lead of the team responsible for
    developing a npm library that acts as an SDK to access hardware devices.
    These devices include payment terminals, card readers, keepers, etc. We had
    a lot of work to provide a compatibility between hardware devices and the
    front-end.

    I was a part of outsource company that provides service in Web-related
    products. Right from the beginning I took part in the team that develops a
    product for integrating banner-based ads on customers' websites. Meaning,
    you, as a customer, could integrate and configure advertisements on your
    website without developers. Just by using an admin panel we had.

    Our target audience was small businesses that had a transport park. The
    problem we were solving is to provide an easy-to-use web interface for those
    customers to monitor the status of each vehicle. Each vehicle had a GPS
    tracker we persistently monitor and log coordinates into the archive. Using
    the information from that archive we were building timelines, statistics,
    real-time location, etc.
